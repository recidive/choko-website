Choko is an Open Source project, there are many ways you can contribute to help improve Choko. Either you are a coder or not, there's always a way you can get involved, just pick the one that you feel more comfortable with.

## Development

If you are a developer, you can get involved with Choko core development, as well as start your own Choko extension project by using Choko APIs. A good way to find what to work on is checking the issue queue.

## Testing and bug reporting

Choko is under active development, as every piece of software, sometimes things may not work properly, we need people to test, break things and report back as issues, then developers will take care of given proper feedback.

## Documentation

Developers are always busy with coding the next thing you'll use, but documenting them are not always their top priority. Also freeing developers from having to write in languages other than the programming ones can keep them focused on doing what they do better.

## Spreading the word

If you think Choko is a good thing, feel completely free to share it with your friends and spread the word. You can do so by liking our Facebook page, tweeting or blogging about the project or in any way you want.
