## Installation

Installing Choko is a easy task, you just need access to the command line for installing and starting the application.

### Requirements

Choko was built in Node.js, so basically you need a machine where you can run Node.js applications.

 - **Server:** A server capable of running Node.js and MongoDB.
 - **Node.js version:** Choko requires Node.js version 0.10 or above.
 - **Database:** Although we support multiple databases via [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline). Choko was only tested with MongoDB.

### Install Choko with NPM

    $ npm install -g choko

Create an application:

    $ choko myApp

By default Choko will start on port 3000. Check [the documentation](/documentation/installation) for more ways you can install Choko.
