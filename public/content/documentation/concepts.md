Choko has some concepts that abstracts the pieces you need in every web application.

## Core concepts

### Types

Types define your application objects, for example, a contact management application has a "contact" type, an e-commerce application has "product" and "order" types, and so on.

### Fields

A type usually has one or more fields that set what properties it holds. Choko comes with several field types for the most common data you may need in your application.

### Extensions

Extensions encapsulates one or more generic functionalities that can be shared and reused across applications.

### Hooks

Hooks are the way extensions can create dinamic structures on the system as well as modify other extensions structures and functionality.

## Core types

Choko comes with some complex types which are referred as the 'core types' and are responsible for building the application itself, or implement something that's common to every application.

The main core types are:

 - Pages
 - Panels
 - Contexts
 - Navigations
 - Layouts
 - Routes
 - Users
 - Roles
 - Permissions
