Choko is an innovative web application development framework. To program in Choko, it's not necessary to know any programming language. Just set parameters and create resources and rules that will be made automatically into pages and screens compatible with many devices such as tablets, smartphones and notebooks.

By abstracting the small pieces common to every application such as user authentication, access control, page layouting, navigations, forms, themes, etc. you can focus on what really matters for your application to flourish: your ideas.

Choko is how Australians call chayote. Chayotes are rapid growing plants that raise and spread fastly, their fruits could be seen as the connected nodes of the [Giant Global Graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph) that the WWW is transforming into.
